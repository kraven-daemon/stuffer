## Different types of shells

### From old to newest
- ash, in busybox
POSIX compatible.
So called swiss army knife of shells, used for embedding shell within an environnement.
Comes with a lot of tiny executables.

- bash and mksh
Default on Linux. The equivalent of the korn shell on BSD's.

- dash
POSIX compatible. From debian/ubuntu, run background script faster.

- fish
Friendly and interactive shell, lots of incompatible features with other shells.

- zsh
The fully featured for interactive uses. A compatible fish shell.
Linux, Bsd's and now the default on Macos.

- nushell
Datadriven shell, treat your environment/os like a database.

Experimental.
The `dataframes` module comes with a lot of functions and utilities for piping typed datasets,
It aims to be a good way to replace python's big data intensive analysis stack(numpy, mathplotlib, scipy, etc...)
with a simpler and straight forward interface for database day-to-day tasks.
