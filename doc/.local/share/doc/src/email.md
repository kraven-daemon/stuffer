## Email related stuff

#### Mail server, using smtp protocol
also known as MTA : Mail transfer agent
 - When you have multiple email address you want to merge
 - When you just want to admin you own email server
 - When you want to send email
worth noticing all major smtp server also provide sendmail/delivery functionality

Mail agents, transport emails
also know as MDA : Mail delivery agent
    - When you want to retrieve email from a server
    - When you want to , optionnally, filter emails

Mail readers, or email client
also know as MUA : Mail user agent
    - When you want to parse/read email as text/html
    - When you you want to admin mailboxes

NOTABLE UTILS -> mblaze
    Contains a lot of cli-function to scan,filter address, etc, given a Maildir directory structure

Format -> probably Maildir _> a specification
    Maildir/{cur,new,tmp}
    not sure about Maildir++
    like dir.subdir

Minimalist suggestion

Exim _> Smtp server with `with extensive facilities for checking incoming e-mail.`
    meaning
GNU Mailman : a email list management utility design to be used with a smtp server

Neomutt _> ncurse email client pretty cool

fetchmail _> retrieve email and store them


Recommended -> implicit TLS -> avoid maninthemiddle attack
